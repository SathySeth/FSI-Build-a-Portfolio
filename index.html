      <h3>About Me</h3
        <p>I'm a Filipino American living in Southern California. I recently found the passion to learn more into life. I'm good with people and I love the color purple. My favorite cartoon is Steven Universe and favorite character is Garnet. I want people to remember by them knowing I was always there for them when they needed someone to talk to. The biggest mistake I've ever learned from was not showing up for myself and doing nothing about it. My first ever job was being a security guard for Angel Stadium. I was able to make great friends, but once I left I never saw them again. I learned that security guard jobs is difficult, if some are not fighters/physical protectors. Personaly it is not for me.</p>
